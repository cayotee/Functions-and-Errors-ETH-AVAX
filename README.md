# Solidity Sample Contract

This project demonstrates a simple Solidity smart contract showcasing basic functionalities like depositing, withdrawing, and error handling using the require keyword.

## Description

The sampleContract is a Solidity contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw funds. It includes functions for depositing an amount into the contract, withdrawing an amount from the contract, an example of using the require keyword for input validation, an example of using the assert keyword, and an example of causing a transaction to revert using the revert keyword.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To interact with this contract, you'll need a development environment with Solidity support. You can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

### Executing program

1. Navigate to the directory where the contract file is located.
2. Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler like solc.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to your desired Ethereum network.
